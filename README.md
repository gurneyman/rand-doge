## Hypothetical Additions Given More Time

1. Better handling of loading states -- Images in particular could load a lo-fi version, etc to be a bit more obvious than simply disabling the button. I considered using a lib for this, but decided to keep things simple considering the size of the project. 

2. Image history -- It would be cool to be able to cycle through images that have already been viewed, possibly through a gallery or slider. Something similar to Spotify's listen history for example.

3. Error Handling -- My handling of api responses is optimistic which I would never to in a real application. At the very least a global Error Boundry to handle errors and send them to a log service

4. Persistence -- So users could favorite or create dog playlists

5. Social -- Coupled with above so users could share with friends

6. Breed information -- Could link to wikipedia or some other source of info about breed. Could integrate with the pet finder api to actually connect users with rescues available
